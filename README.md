# React Editor

## Usage guide
- Add node : Individually select nodes. Groups are considered a single node if you use this option.
- Add nodes by group : Adds all objects in a group (only 1 nested depth) as nodes. Nested depth of 1 means that for nested groups, only the first layer of groupings are added
- One click : Adds all objects in a group (only 1 nested depth) as nodes and resolves the edges as well. Edges are done by proximity, all objects with edges near to each other (margin of 3 pixels) will have edges created between them.
- Use node labels : When checked, tries to match the category of node with the figma name/label of the object (check left hand side layers and assets).
